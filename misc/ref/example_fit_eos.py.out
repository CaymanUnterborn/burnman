Least squares equation of state fitting

1) Fitting to PTV data only

Optimized equation of state:
V_0: (1.1232 +/- 0.0004) x 1e-05
K_0: (1.58 +/- 0.04) x 1e+11
Kprime_0: (4.4 +/- 0.4) x 1e+00
grueneisen_0: (1.9 +/- 0.2) x 1e+00
q_0: (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 1e+00

Clearly a PVT fit of a PVT equation of state can produce some surprising thermodynamic predictions. This is because PVT alone may not provide strong constraints on all parameters. In this case, grueneisen_0 and q_0 have very large covariances, which is undesirable.

Can we improve on this "optimal" PVT fit?

2) Fitting to PTV *and* PT-enthalpy data

Optimized equation of state:
V_0: (1.1231 +/- 0.0003) x 1e-05
K_0: (1.61 +/- 0.04) x 1e+11
Kprime_0: (4.1 +/- 0.3) x 1e+00
grueneisen_0: (1.38 +/- 0.02) x 1e+00
q_0: (0.0 +/- 0.4) x 1e+00
F_0: (-5.6856 +/- 0.0002) x 1e+05

Hurrah! That looks much better! Note that not only have the errors on grueneisen_0 and q_0 got smaller, but they have also moved well-outside the previous 1-s.d. uncertainty bounds. Plus, now the heat capacities don't blow up at high temperature. Cool, huh?!
