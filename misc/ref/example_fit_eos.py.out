Least squares equation of state fitting

1) Fitting to high pressure PTV data only

Optimized equation of state:
V_0: (1.1232 +/- 0.0004) x 1e-05
K_0: (1.58 +/- 0.04) x 1e+11
Kprime_0: (4.4 +/- 0.4) x 1e+00
grueneisen_0: (1.9 +/- 0.2) x 1e+00
q_0: (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 1e+00

Fitting an equation of state using only high pressure P-T-V data can produce some surprising (read incorrect) thermodynamic predictions. We must use additional data to provide strong constraints on all parameters. In this case, we would like to improve our constraints on grueneisen_0 and q_0.

How should we improve on this "optimal" PVT fit?

2) Fitting to PTV *and* PT-enthalpy data

Optimized equation of state:
V_0: (1.1238 +/- 0.0002) x 1e-05
K_0: (1.54 +/- 0.03) x 1e+11
Kprime_0: (4.5 +/- 0.3) x 1e+00
grueneisen_0: (1.37 +/- 0.02) x 1e+00
q_0: (-4 +/- 4) x 1e-01
F_0: (-5.6856 +/- 0.0002) x 1e+05

Hurrah! That looks much better! Note that not only have the errors on grueneisen_0 and q_0 got smaller, but they have also moved well-outside the previous 1-s.d. uncertainty bounds. Plus, now the heat capacities don't blow up at high temperature. Cool, huh?!
